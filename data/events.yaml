    falls, broken only by the low, sorcerous hum of ancient hatred given wings. The air itself curdles around its form 
    as the titanic, shadow-wreathed citadel ascends, blotting out the sky. Where its fell silhouette passes, daylight 
    withers, hope chills, and the land beneath lies cursed in a premature and ominous dusk.
