hammer_of_kharas:
  description: >
    The Hammer of Kharas was named for the dwarven hero, Kharas, who wielded the hammer during the Dwarfgate 
    Wars, although the hammer was forged more than two thousand years prior to that great battle. History prior to 
    Kharas records it as being called the Hammer of Honor. 
    Forged in 2,072 PC by the dwarves of Thorbardin as a replica of the hammer of Reorx, the dwarves presented it to 
    Ergoth as an offering of peace. 
    The hammer would remain with Ergoth for centuries, until it would appear once again during the Third Dragon War, 
    when Huma Dragonbane sought out a dwarven smith in Ergoth, bearing the blessed Silver Arm of Ergoth and the Hammer 
    of Honor. This dwarven smith, with the divine power of the Hammer of Kharas and the Silver Arm was able to forge
    the first dragonlances.
