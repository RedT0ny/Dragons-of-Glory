    *** Dragonlance Chronicles ***
    
    Five years ago, a band of good friends frequented the Inn of the Last Home, the most popular tavern and inn in the 
    treetop town of Solace. They made a pact to go off on their own in search of some sign of the true gods, agreeing 
    to meet back at the Inn of the Last Home on that day five years later. Each taking a different path, they set out 
    for the far corners of Ansalon. Now the heroes, known as the Innfellows, return to their hometown after finding 
    only futility—the true gods seem to be well and truly gone. However, at the very least, they can look forward to a 
    warm fire, a good meal, and the companionship of their dearest friends upon their return. 
    
    Unfortunately, they find that Solace has changed in their absence. The Seekers, a misguided religious sect of 
    questionable sincerity, have become the temporal rulers of Solace, governing the region from the nearby Lordcity 
    of Haven. Rumors of war and whispers of monsters and death circulate among the farmers and townsfolk in hushed 
    voices. Solace has changed, and that change promises to become even more drastic.

  notes: >
    Whitestone starts without countries, they will join by diplomacy or as a result of the highlord's invasion.' 
    The player with the most countries held consults the victory table.
    Dragonflights do not count towards the number of countries controlled.
