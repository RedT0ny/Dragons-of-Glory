  description: >
    At the time of the Cataclysm, the major fleets of Ansalon were swept into history. Only three major fleets remained: 
    the great ships of Silvanesti, the Palanthian trade ships, and the scattered remains of the Istar fleet at sea.

    In the period of barbarism which followed, the shattered fleet of Istar found more profit when acting as coastal 
    pirate raiders. The ships' captains were quick to realize that their Minotaur slaves were of great value in their 
    newfound professions, and before many decades had passed, the minotaurs of Kothas and Mithas had built fleets of 
    their own. In the meanwhile, all the seas of Eastern Ansalon were the unchallenged domain of the pirate raiders.
    
    Silvanesti had slept in its self-imposed exile for centuries, until the thundering dragons came from the north and 
    forced them into flight. With nowhere else to go, the great fleet of the elves sailed north into the Bloodsea 
    seeking passage to more peaceful, western lands.
    
    The pirates had never taken on so large a collection of wealth or sea power. The minotaurs, while not allies to be 
    trusted, would certainly be of help. It was a trap with a prey too large to be held at the whirling brim of the 
    Maelstrom.
