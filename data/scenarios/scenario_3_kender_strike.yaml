    *** The Kender Strike ***
    
    The most humorous defeat of the Dragon-army occurred at the hands of the kender of Hylo. 
    That unpredictable race (whose members are best avoided by all sensible folk) proved to be 
    as tenacious as it was resilient.
    
    Because of damage sustained in battle, my ship, the Regent’s Crown, required immediate 
    repairs. We therefore made a brief stop in the kender port of Hylo. It was here that we 
    were treated to a most entertaining display of the ingenuity of that diminutive race. 
    The Dragon Highlords had managed to land an army on Northern Ergoth, under the command of a 
    brutal hobgoblin — Toede by name. It was a weak force by Dragonarmy standards, primarily
    goblins and hobgoblins, but nevertheless posed a grave threat to the kender on the island. 
    This evil force would have conquered were not the kender suddenly united under the command 
    of one Kronin Thistleknott. Kronin was undoubtedly strange for a kender. While personable 
    and mischievous, he also had a sense of purpose, destiny, and leadership, qualities unusual 
    in a kender.
    
    Kronin managed to unite the different family clans of the kender in Hylo under his guidance. 
    The clans went along since it sounded like something far less boring than their lives had 
    been thus far. (Although several kender clans thought it would be great fun to become subjects 
    of the Highlords and send all their old, boring objects as tribute.)
    
    Toede’s force attacked the port the day after we called there, and we witnessed an unusual 
    battle. The kender forces trooped through the city in chaotic fashion. I had the impression 
    they thought they were attending a carnival. They drew up into a thin line north of the city 
    as the evil army came into view.
    
    And then the kender began to taunt! My ears have never been treated to such a variety of 
    insults and verbal abuse. Of course, the hobgoblins and goblins went berserk, attacking 
    wildly with no sense of order.
    
    This was all part of the plan, as the kender fell back in the center and drew the monsters 
    into a narrow corridor of death. The kender attack was speedy and merciless and the surrounded
    monsters were massacred. The forces of evil were dealt a stunning defeat at the hands of the 
    kender that day.
