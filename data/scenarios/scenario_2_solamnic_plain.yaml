    *** The Solamnic Plain ***
    
    The Solamnic Plain was more than just a political and geographical barrier, it was the heartland of food production 
    in western Ansalon. Control of the plain thus became the major focus of the war effort. 
    
    Powerful armies of the Blue and Red Dragon Wings entered the plain in the early summer of 351 AC.
    The Blue Wing forces crossed the Estwilde to Kalaman and then turned west, rounding the north end of the Dargaard 
    Mountains and following the Vingaard River across the plain to the southwest crossings near Vingaard Keep. 
    The Red Wing forces, combined with hobgoblins, pressed through the Throtyl Gap and moved west toward Solanthus.
    
    Despite solemn treaties, the Lemish forces joined the rapidly advancing Dragonarmy and laid siege to Solanthus at 
    the north point of the Garnet Mountains. Fortunately, elements of the Solamnic forces in Caergoth were able to 
    engage the enemy in the Thelgaard Gap and thereby protect the western shores of Solamnia. 
    
    On the northern front, the Blue Dragon Wing quickly laid siege to Vingaard Keep, the gateway to the northwest 
    plains. The Vingaard troops were unable to hold the citadel and the largely mercenary force retreated west to the 
    High Clerist Tower. 
    
    Both the northern and southern Dragon Wings had dangerously extended their supply routes. Their advance was slowed 
    sufficiently that they were forced into a winter war. In the south this became a bitter and desperate struggle 
    between two determined forces. 
    
    In the north, one objective burned in the hearts of the Dragon Highlords: Palanthas. The only major port untouched 
    by the Cataclysm, its fleets retained the might and glory of ancient times. This was a prize that could not be 
    ignored. Yet the value of the prize was ignored by the Palanthians themselves. They stubbornly clung to the belief
    that they would be spared by the dragon empire because they were a center of culture. This remarkable and misguided 
    view nearly cost that great city all it held dear. 
    
    Dragons gave the Dragon Highlords mastery of the skies and made the defense difficult, almost hopeless. Yet in the 
    darkest hour, the dragons of good again returned to the world and allied with the forces of the Whitestone. 
    This was the turn of the tide...
