    *** The Siege of Kalaman ***
    
    Kalaman was a port of supreme importance to the Dragon Highlords. It was a port on 
    the northern shores of Ansalon and thus a necessary link between the pirate bases of 
    the Maelstrom and the central government of Sanction. It also represented an opportunity 
    to throw back the Whitestone forces and turn the tide of the war. Moreover, the Dark 
    Lady had her own personal score to settle with the commander of the Kalaman Forces. For 
    it was Laurana who had defeated her at the High Clerist Tower and that same Golden 
    General now watched over Kalaman.
    
    The defenses of Kalaman and its environs were as good as any in Ansalon. The port itself 
    was flanked to the north by a wide bay that emptied into the sea. The rushing waters of 
    the Vingaard River to the west restricted massive troop movements. The city walls held 
    well to the south and were arranged to great advantage of the defender against ground 
    troops.
    
    Yet no roof covered Kalaman’s head. The Dragon Highlords had something new in the offing, 
    a threat that would change the tide of the war yet again. From the south came massive
    fortresses built atop rock ripped from the living stone. They floated through the sky 
    with no more effort than a breeze. Within their bowels dwelt armies of draconians and 
    dragons. The great craft maneuvered toward Kalaman and prepared to disgorge their 
    troops like hail from the sky.
    
    Though the good dragons fought with the troops of Kalaman, as the battle raged back and 
    forth, Kalaman slowly diminished in strength.
