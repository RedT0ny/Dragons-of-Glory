    *** War of the Lance ***
    
    After her defeat in the Age of Dreams, Takhisis swore that she and her children, the chromatic dragons, would leave 
    the world of mortals. The dragons knew this as the Oath of Finality. Thus the chromatic dragons slumbered for over 
    a thousand years in hidden places throughout Ansalon - from the red dragon lairs in the Khalkist Mountains, to the 
    glacial hibernation caves of the white dragons in Icereach. Even the Cataclysm did not stir the chromatic dragons, 
    though the land buckled and shifted in the wake of the fiery mountain’s fall.
    
    As the metallic dragons slept, Takhisis launched an insidious plot. The crafty red dragon Harkiel the Bender and 
    other dragons of evil stole the eggs of the metallic dragons from their caches in the Dragon Isles, and transported 
    them to a secret location beneath the volcanic mountain range known as the Lords of Doom.
    
    Takhisis appeared as a bodiless spirit before the good dragons, waking them from their long hibernation, to tell 
    them that she would crush the eggs unless the metallic dragons agreed to stay out of the upcoming war, promising 
    to return the dragons’ eggs once the war had concluded. The metallic dragons, counseled by their gold and silver 
    leaders, reluctantly assured the Dark Queen that they would not intervene in the war. Even Paladine, who understood 
    that his children had been forced into this agreement, sadly recognized the power of their Oath.
    
    The period from 332 AC to 340 AC saw the birth of the dragonarmies. Guided by their Dark Queen, the evil dragons 
    form an unholy alliance with a handful of ruthless individuals, who had been drawn together by Takhisis with 
    promises of wealth and dominion. Chief among these was a human, Duulket Ariakas, a bloodthirsty warlord and 
    former Black Robe wizard, whose brilliant strategic mind and personal strength greatly appealed to Takhisis. She 
    charged Ariakas with the selection and training of her new army, accomplished under the guise of a mercenary lord 
    consolidating his own power. In truth, Ariakas was to be her Dragon Emperor, and the first of the dragon highlords.

    The chromatic dragons were the cornerstone of Ariakas’ efforts. Their sheer power meant that no ordinary force 
    could stand up to them. This, along with their hereditary thirst for revenge against Huma’s heirs, meant that the 
    chromatic dragons would be a formidable foe. Meanwhile, Ariakas and his highlords assembled mercenaries and recruits
    from the Khalkists and neighboring Estwilde to further augment the army of the Dark Queen.
    
    With the Taman Busuk and Estwilde already under the control of the dragonarmies by 337 AC, Ariakas looked east...
