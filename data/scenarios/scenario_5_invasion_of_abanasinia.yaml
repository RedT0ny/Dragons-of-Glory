    Abanasinia once was a center of trade and commerce. Great caravans would come south from the rich
    lands of Solamnia, on their way to the dwarven kingdom of Thorbardin. One of the finest religious
    libraries of the Age of Might, second only to that of Palanthus itself, was located at Xak Tsaroth in
    the heart of the Abanasinic region. Though once torn by war and strife as the dwarves, Qualinesti
    elves and Solamnic humans struggled to establish the boundaries of their land in the latter days of
    the Age of Might, Abanasinia was a region of peace and enlightenment.
    
    All of that changed with the Cataclysm. Much of Abanasinia fell beneath the waves of the New Sea.
    Xak Tsaroth was swallowed into the earth itself and all the land was plunged into fear and anarchy.
    After an initial period of chaos, culminating with the Dwarfgate War in 121 AC, peace was again
    restored to the land. The Thorbardin dwarves had disappeared from the face of the world, and the
    Qualinesti elves again fell back into their enchanted lands. Mankind created new homes, some in
    the trees of Solace and others in the plains beyond. Humans slumbered in their domestic
    tranquility, unaware of the storms of war gathering about them in the world.
    
    Then in the summer of 351 AC, war came to Abanasinia. The Red Wing of the Dragon Highlords,
    under the command of Dragon Highlord Verminaard, landed on the northern shores of Abanasinia
    and also at the small fishing harbor of Newports. The dragons' might swept across the land and
    moved quickly to subjugate all of the land and the population in it.
    
    The humans were totally disorganized and could offer only a token resistance. Only the elves and
    the dwarves had the might and will to resist the onslaught, yet the elves wanted nothing over their
    own survival. The dwarves were buried under the mountain and did not seem willing to appear. Not
    until the thunder struck did either nation wake up to the conflict.
    
    Though not fully mobilized until the armies of the Dragon Highlords were crossing their own
    borders, the Qualinesti elves were not unprepared. Their spirited resistance was insufficient,
    however, to stop the juggernaut. Only by the distraction of the dwarves on the south, caused by the
    actions of heroes, were the Qualinesti elves relieved of the constant fight and the Dwarves brought
    into the war.
